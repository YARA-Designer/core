##Frontend
* Make encapsulator work with click (surround elements currently in editor div)
* Add some sort of hashed "state" string to URL to reproduce the current editor elements from URL.
* Properly implement showing of column error occured on (currently just appended to SyntaxError str).
* Split (what's possible) of script blocks into separate .js files.

### Bugs:
* Drag and drop won't work until you've added at least one item to the editor, 
  likely issue with no existing items to sort with.
